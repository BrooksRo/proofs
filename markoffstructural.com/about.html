<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Paul and Sandra  Markoff founded MSPCCI in July 1982. After many years in the Termite Control and Construction industry, coupled with exposure to new construction, Paul decided it was time  to start his own company. He made the decision to include family members, along  with friends and former employees, to complete his support system. After 28  years of service Paul and his son, Steve Markoff, and his long time  friend/co-worker Stan Miller continue to provide the necessary support and  commitment to their loyal clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s unique  style of &ldquo;BUSINESS WITH A HANDSHAKE&rdquo; has paid off for him and his company. His  clients have learned to trust his word and those of his representatives. Paul  continues, after forty years in this industry, to operate his business in a  user-friendly manner. </p>

<h2>Client Testimonials:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&quot;When the bank told us we'd need a renovation loan and a contractor   approved to do a large pest repair, Steve helped us out! Our house   purchase went through, and the pest repair was completed practically   before we moved in -- and this wasn't a small job! The stucco work was   fantastic -- you can't see where the facade was replaced on our house.<br>
  <br>
  Because   of their great work on the pest repair, we had Markoff do more general   contracting work on our roof, light well, and all new windows. We have   recommended them to family members, so we'd recommend them to anyone.&quot;</em> - Kate W.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&quot;We've worked with the Markoffs for some time now. They have a good   knowledge of buildings and construction. They're good at what they do,   no shoddy work. I highly recommend them.&quot;</em> - Brent S.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&quot;We're buying our first house and were referred to Paul Markoff by our real estate agent.  Paul   himself came out to inspect and did a great job - finding and   explaining some defects that were not detected by the seller's initial   pest report. &nbsp;He carefully and patiently explained each defect/issue to   me.  I recommend Markoff because Paul detected some defects/issues that the previous inspector had missed.&quot;</em> - Deann F. </p>
