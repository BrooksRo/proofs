    <p>From Gary Amlinger CFT<br>
      Founder of Destination Fitness Personal Training<br>
      Serving Long Island, New York</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Dear Friend, <br>
        Hey I'm Gary Amlinger... a Long Island fitness trainer, professional fitness model and body sculpting specialist.  <strong>I have some personal  questions to ask you and it's important that you answer them truthfully... </strong></p>
      <ul class="arrow">
        <li>Have  you ever walked into a social gathering and immediately experienced feelings of  self consciousness due to the other attendees displaying a more healthful  appearance? </li>
        <li>Have  you ever felt that sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach as you walked  into a business affair, knowing that you were out of shape and lacked the  confidence to boldly follow through?</li>
        <li>Do  you fear your significant other's attraction toward you is waning and he or she  might go elsewhere?</li>
        <li>Do  you avoid dating because you just don't feel secure enough about the way that  you look and feel?</li>
        <li>Do  you feel like you have less fulfilling relationships with friends and family  because you're not completely happy with yourself?</li>
        <li>Do  you dread seeing your reflection in the mirror and wish that the person looking  back at you, was healthier and in better shape?</li>
        <li>Have  you experienced feelings of inadequacy or even embarrassment when being  intimate with another person, which prohibits you from enjoying intimacy to its  fullest?</li>
        <li>Do  you sometimes feel guilty about neglecting your health, knowing that it does  not only affect your way of life, but the life of your loved ones as well? </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>If you answered &quot;YES&quot; to any of these questions, let me tell you that you are certainly NOT ALONE. I know because at one point in my life, I could have answered &quot;YES&quot; to every single question above...</strong></p>
      <p>If you've never been told  this before, allow me to be the first to tell you that IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. It  is 100% not your fault that the media has countless views that misinform YOU on  what works and what doesn't work in exercise and nutrition. </p>
      <p> We live in a world where TV  and magazines advertise fad diets and overly complicated workout routines that  do absolutely nothing, but &quot;WOW&quot; you into thinking that these methods  actually work and take your hard earned money... </p>
      <p> Well, as I am sure you have  found out first hand, they do not work. And not only do these fitness fads not  work, but they're remarkably unhealthy. </p>
      <p> <strong>Working  as a professional fitness model for almost a decade, I have tapped into a world  that most of humanity will never get to experience... </strong></p>
      <p> Being immersed in an  environment that seeks perfection in every way possible, there is no room for  inadequate nutrition plans or ineffective training methods.</p>
      <p> Working as a fitness model,  if you aren't in near perfect shape year round, you will not receive work and  in turn, cannot support yourself to live... </p>
      <p> Through many years of  research, employing countless exercise science and nutrition methods and my  experience as a professional fitness model, where I was immersed in an  environment surrounded by some of the best physiques in the world... </p>
      <p> <strong>I  am now able to bring YOU the true solution to developing an attractive, <em>lean</em> and <em>healthy</em> body...   </strong></p>

      <h4 align="center">I wasn't always Mr. Fitness...</h4>
      <img src="images/before-test.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Before" class="floatright">
      <p><strong>During  my high school years, I was VERY self conscious about the way that I looked.</strong> Being that I was 120 lbs (On a good day...), you could only imagine how often I  was teased and ridiculed. </p>
      <p> Having an extremely unhealthy  self image, my self esteem was at an absolute ZERO. I was so insecure about the  way that I looked, that I would actually AVOID interacting with people at social  outings. And when people would approach me to be sociable, I would completely  freeze up and hardly be able to speak (Yes, it was THAT bad)... </p>
      <p> I couldn't stand interacting  with other people because I was just so <em>unhappy</em> with myself. I was too scared to talk to women, let alone date them. I couldn't  stick to a job or school schedule because of my &quot;phobia&quot; of being  around other people. My family and friends always wondered why I never smiled,  and that probably hurt the most...</p>
      <p> The thing is... I WANTED to  be happy... I WANTED to enjoy interactions with family and friends... I WANTED  to be able to look at myself in the mirror without cringing... I WANTED to end  my bouts with depression caused from not being able to attract a lover or  quality friends in my life. </p>
      <p> <strong>But  I was just so disgusted with the way that I looked and felt inside... </strong></p>
      <p><strong> In  a nutshell, I felt WORTHLESS. I had no control over myself or any significant  aspect of my life. Something HAD to change... </strong></p>
      <p> It always fascinated me to  see how people could literally transform their bodies from being overweight or  skinny, to adopting a persona of power and confidence through exercise. </p>
      <p> After a ton of  self-education on health and fitness, I decided to start my journey to a  sculpted, attractive physique...  </p>
      <p> As the occasional workout started  to develop into a more consistent activity, I began to realize exercise had  become my very own &quot;therapy&quot;. Being that I was socially clumsy,  insecure and unhappy with the way that I looked and felt, exercise became an  outlet for me to release all of my stress and frustrations.  </p>
      <p> The thing is... as great as  the feeling was from exercising and all... I still wasn't getting the RESULTS  that I wanted. I was still very unhappy with the way that I looked, and exercising  wasn't really doing much for my physique... </p>
      <p> I'd workout for long periods  of time and put EVERY OUNCE OF ENERGY I had into each workout, but I still  wasn't reaping the benefits that I saw all the people in the magazines were getting!   </p>
      <p> Out of desperation, I  started to try out the so called &quot;top&quot; training and nutrition  programs you see on TV and in magazines... But as you could expect, <em>none of them actually worked... </em></p>
      <p> I didn't know what to do  anymore... The fact that I couldn't figure out how to get into shape, no matter  how much I researched and tried every training and nutrition method under the  sun... and no matter how much energy I put into every workout... FRUSTURATED ME  BEYOND BELIEF! </p>
      <p> I had tried it ALL, from complicated  workout videos to &quot;magical&quot; supplements and pills, but it was all  completely useless!</p>
      <p> <strong>As  I became more and more frustrated with myself and my life, I finally had  ENOUGH. I decided it was time to take a more radical approach... </strong></p>
      <p><strong> This  is when I made it my number one goal in life to learn the <em>most effective</em> way to get an attractive, sculpted body... </strong></p>
      <p><strong> And  I would do so by <em>personally</em> learning from  the best physiques on the planet... </strong></p>
      <p> It was at this low point in  my life, I decided to join the Mecca Of Bodybuilding, Bev Francis Gold's Gym.  Bev Francis Gold's Gym is one of the top physique gyms in America. Supermodels,  professional athletes and famous actors work out there on a daily basis, and I  felt it was a great opportunity for me to find out what REALLY works in  achieving an attractive physique.</p>
      <p> From the moment I stepped  into Gold's Gym, I began to pick the brain of every model, professional athlete  and well known actor that I came across. I would literally SURVEY every single  one of them...</p>
      <p> Actually, now that I think  about it... I almost got kicked out of the gym on a few occasion's for &quot;bothering&quot;  the &quot;famous&quot; people a little bit too much...</p>
      <p> But it ended up being ALL  worth it in the end! What I had learned from them was exactly what I needed to  take my physique to an entirely new level. I was able to weed out ALL of the  useless, hyped up training and nutrition methods, and use the systems that  ACTUALLY WORKED in transforming your body. </p>
      <p>Learning from the people who  have achieved what I wanted to, which was sporting an attractive and healthy  body, was more valuable than anything I ever tried before... </p>
      <p><strong><img src="images/after-test.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="floatright">Over  the next 2 years of working out alongside the world's top physiques, I put on  over 60 lbs of muscle mass, all the while maintaining a 5% body fat percentage,  WITHOUT the use of harmful drugs or surgery... </strong></p>
      <p> However, the way I looked  was only the tip of the iceberg. The most rewarding part of getting into shape  was <em>how I felt inside</em>. To put it simply,  my self-acceptance and self love (Which I really didn't have much of from the  beginning...) had sky rocketed.  </p>
      <p> I was no longer teased, but  instead <em>respected and loved</em>. Socially  confident I now <em>enjoyed</em> being with people instead of dreading social situations. I  was able to freely approach women without fear, although I didn't really have  to because I was the one getting approached  most of the time! My career and school performance improved tenfold... </p>
      <p> I mean literally EVERYTHING  got better in my life... I now harnessed a sense of well being and vivacity  that I never had before. </p>
      <p> <strong>And  let me tell you something... When YOU wake up in the morning energized and excited  about your day, your whole life changes... Your entire outlook on life is  altered in a way that anything you want to achieve is within your grasp. </strong></p>
      <p><strong><em>And this is where the  power lies in living a fit lifestyle... </em></strong></p>

    <h4 align="center">Having Immersed myself in the world of fitness modeling, I am now able to BRING YOU THE MOST POTENT BODY SHAPING CONCEPTS on Earth... </h4>
    <p>I knew I had come a LONG way  when I stepped on stage at my first natural bodybuilding contest. Flashbacks of  the days of unhappiness and frustration would come to mind when thinking about  the useless fad workouts and intolerable diets I put myself through. Fortunately,  those days were long gone... </p>
    <p> <strong>However  , it wasn't until I became certified as a personal trainer and began to  transform the bodies of my close friends and family with SHOCKING RESULTS, that  I truly realized I had cultivated extremely effective exercise and nutrition  concepts... </strong></p>
    <p> Competing in the INBF  (International Natural Bodybuilding and Fitness), which is one of the top  All-Natural Federations in Natural Bodybuilding, I placed as one of the top  ranked teenagers in New York. After my first competition, I was contacted by  top fitness publications such as Exercise For Men Only and Natural Bodybuilding  and Fitness to be featured in their magazines. </p>
    <p> <strong>This  was the beginning of my fitness modeling career and eventually exposure to the  most effective body shaping concepts in the world...  </strong></p>
    <p> After much publicity from  being featured in numerous fitness magazines, I came in contact with one of the  top fitness modeling agencies in New York City, Silver Model Management. </p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/silver-model.jpg" width="129" height="71"></p>
    <p>Silver Models represents  top-tier sports models, professional athletes and established actors who work  with the most recognized companies in the world including Nike, Under Armour  and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Silver Models also works with high end magazines  such as Men's Health and popular TV shows including Conan O'Brien and Saturday  Night Live. </p>
    <p> <strong>Signing  with Silver Model Management and immersing myself in the environment of  modeling, allowed me to expand my knowledge and skills of fitness even further  than I ever thought possible... </strong></p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/pretty-masculine.jpg" width="295" height="99"></p>
    <p>Before I knew it, I was  shooting commercials for MTV, work out videos for the world's leading fitness  modeling website, Strengthnet.com, and being photographed by top fitness  photographers Norberto Torriente and Bill Terry, who's work can be seen in top  fitness magazines such as Muscular Development and Exercise For Men Only, and  celebrity photographer Mike Ruiz, who has done photo shoots with the &quot;who's  who&quot; of celebrities, including Justin Timberlake, Eva Longoria, Christian  Bale, Kate Beckinsale, and Kim Kardashian. I eventually made my way into making  appearances in  Apple applications, such  as &quot;Pretty Masculine&quot;, and doing fight choreography for international  films. </p>
    <h4>Learning from the most fit people on the planet allowed me to refine  my fitness skill set, taking away PRICELESS nutrition and exercise techniques  that can be used to shape YOUR body into an <em>enviable</em>,  <em>sculpted</em> and <em>undeniably attractive</em> form... </h4>
    <p><em>Deciding  to dedicate my life to being a fitness trainer</em>, I  armed myself with one of the leading certifications for fitness trainers in the  country, the Certified Fitness Trainer certification from the International  Sports Sciences Association. <br>
      The ISSA CFT certification  is nationally accredited, backed by some of the industry's top fitness  professionals throughout North America, who's teachings are some of the most  prestigious and respected in the fitness field. The ISSA CFT is also held by  some of the best fitness trainers in the world including celebrity trainer,  Jackie Warner.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/model-pic.jpg" width="400" height="509"></p>
    <p><strong>After  my physique transformation and the transformation of the many people I have  trained during my fitness modeling and personal training career, it became  clear to me that personal training is the vocation I truly love and feel the most fulfilled doing. </strong></p>
    <p><strong> I  have a burning desire and passion to help people through fitness. I know from  firsthand experience, what a sound mind and healthy body can do for someone's  life...</strong></p>

      <h4 align="center">Fitness ads subject YOU to COUNTLESS <em>lies</em>, <em>myths</em> and <em>misconceptions</em> on a daily basis... </h4>
      <img src="images/fitness-glyphs.png" width="510" height="82" alt="Fitness" class="glyphs">
      <p>Society and the media  portray the &quot;most effective&quot; fat loss and muscle building solutions  in ads ranging from magazines to the largest soundboard on earth, the internet. </p>
      <p> But the fact of the matter  is, the people behind these so called &quot;solutions&quot; have an agenda, and  that agenda does not have your best interest at heart. Allow me to share with  you some of the most popular misconceptions that you have been exposed to by  society and the media: </p>
      <ul class="arrow">
        <li>Cardio is the best way to burn fat</li>
        <li>Women should not weight train because they  will get &quot;bulky&quot;</li>
        <li>The only way to get and stay lean is to stay  on a very low calorie diet</li>
        <li>You can burn fat covering a specific muscle  by exercising that muscle group</li>
        <li>Women should workout to burn fat, NOT gain  muscle</li>
        <li>&quot;Diets&quot; are all restrictive and  bland</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Through my own trials and  tribulations, <em>I too have believed many of  the popular myths that are floating around society today</em>. If I didn't get  into the trenches MYSELF to see how fitness really works, I might have never  been able to distinguish the real truth from all the lies... </p>
      <p><strong>Let's take a closer look at these fitness myths:</strong></p>
<ul class="myths">
        <li><p>Cardio is the best way to burn fat... FALSE!  Spending hours upon hours in aerobic style classes and on the treadmill or  elliptical, is actually HURTING your fat burning potential. When you take part  in these types of exercise methods, you're actually losing mostly muscle mass  (Which LOWERS your metabolism) and water weight, NOT FAT!</p>
          <p>The  BEST way to burn fat is to <em>increase your  metabolism</em> through resistance training and high intensity interval  exercises. Having your metabolism soaring 24 hours a day is what will enable  YOU to burn body fat, ALL DAY LONG.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>Women should not weight train because they  will get &quot;bulky&quot;... FALSE! This is possibly the BIGGEST misconception  out of them all! Ladies, you can train with lighter weights, strict form, high  repetitions, low rest periods and build<em> beautiful,  aesthetic</em> bodies.</p>
            <p>You  also do NOT have the hormones to build &quot;bulky&quot; muscle like us men do,  sorry! The female bodybuilder image that comes to mind when you think about  lifting weights is exactly the opposite of what you will look like after taking  part in an effective weight training regimen. Women can and do attain toned, sculpted  bodies through weight training.  </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>The only way to get and stay lean is to stay  on a very low calorie diet... FALSE! When you are on an effective nutrition  plan, you will actually be eating MORE than you normally do, leaving you  feeling fuller as well!</p>
        <p>Low  calorie diets are harmful to your health, leaving you feeling drained and  unmotivated.</p> </li>
        <li><p>You can burn fat covering a specific muscle  by exercising that muscle group... FALSE! Spot reduction is IMPOSSIBLE. Working  out an area of your body (Abs *wink*) will strengthen the muscles UNDERNEATH  whatever it is that is covering it (i.e. Fat!).</p>
        <p>Therefore,  if you have high levels of body fat, you will NOT see your abs any better than  before you decided to exercise them!</p></li>
        <li><p>Women should workout to burn fat, NOT gain  muscle... FALSE! Lean muscle will accentuate the natural, feminine curves of  the female body and keep your metabolism elevated <em>24 hours a day</em>. Muscle BURNS calories 24 hours a day, EVEN WHILE  YOU SLEEP.</p>
          <p><em>Wouldn't you like to burn  calories all day long? </em></p></li>
        <li><p>Diets are all restrictive and bland... FALSE!  Instead of using the word &quot;diet&quot; which has many negative  connotations, I like to use the phrase &quot;nutrition plan&quot; instead.</p>
        <p>Nutrition  plans that are meant to last a lifetime are by no means bland or tasteless.  There is much room for indulging in foods that you enjoy and flavoring the  healthy foods that you consume daily to your liking. There is a wide variety of  foods out there that are both healthy and delicious when prepared the right  way.</p>
        <p><strong>Being healthy is all about  living a fitness lifestyle. Eating foods you do not like will get you about as  far as your will power will take you until you eventually binge. This is what I  look to avoid as a fitness professional! </strong></p>
        <p>In  fact, when on a strategically structured nutrition plan, you can expect to no  longer crave foods that drain you of energy and store body fat. <em>The body begins to crave foods that make  your body feel energized and no longer does it crave foods that will send your  energy levels on a rollercoaster ride.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<h4 align="center">Regardless of what kind of shape you are in  now, realize that I have been there myself....</h4>
      <div class="beforenafter photo"><img src="images/before-02.jpg" width="237" height="350" class="imgpad"><img src="images/after-02.jpg" width="239" height="350" class="imgpad"></div>
      <p>Throughout my life, I have  been at both ends of the body composition spectrum. During my teenage years, I  went from being just skin and bone to adopting a muscular, lean physique. </p>
      <p> At a later date, however, I  suffered a series of very traumatic events, which left me immobile for a VERY  long period of time. This changed my body DRASTICALLY, losing a significant  amount of muscle and gaining over 30 lbs. of body fat... </p>
      <p> But, with my extensive  knowledge of the most potent body shaping concepts on Earth, whipping my body  into the best shape I have ever been in, weighing 210 lbs with under 5% body  fat, was almost too easy... </p>
      <p> <strong>I am LIVING PROOF that no matter what type of  shape you are in RIGHT NOW, you CAN get an attractive, sculpted and lean body... </strong></p>
      <p> I have been in your shoes... I know EXACTLY what it's like... Everything  does happen for a reason and it is of no coincidence you have now found me...  </p>

      <h4 align="center">My exclusive personal training services are most definitely <em>not</em> for everyone... </h4>
      <p>I choose very carefully to only take on clients who are <em>truly motivated </em>to get an attractive,  lean and healthy body. Motivated clients motivate ME to give the absolute best  training experience possible. </p>
      <p> Having gathered priceless and rare knowledge of exercise and nutrition  from the world's top fitness models and celebrities, I am particular with whom  I share this knowledge with... </p>
      <p> Instead of training as many clients as possible, like most personal  trainers <em>attempt</em> to do, I choose to train  a very <em>limited</em> number of clients at  ALL times. This allows me to remain <em>passionate</em> and <em>energized</em> for each of my select  clients, giving them premium <em>service every  single time</em>.</p>
      <p> <strong>A personal trainer is an exceedingly  significant part of one's life and I hold my position in high regard... </strong></p>
      <p> My well being is also directly impacted by the quality of clients I keep  in my life. My choice clients are those rare people who strive to be the best  they can be, who also deserve the finest in return. It is of no coincidence  that they happen to work very hard for what they have, and it's this way of  being that motivates me to work very hard for them... </p>
<p><strong>My Body Sculpting Program Is For Those Who:</strong></p>
<ul class="green">
  <li>Are ready and willing to lead a healthier and  happier lifestyle by committing to at  least a 3 month program or longer, depending upon your goals (My fitness  program is designed to improve your lifestyle, so when you achieve your goals  WITH ME, you will be able to MAINTAIN it for however long you desire. 
    It is statistically proven  that when you practice a new activity for 3 months or longer, you are much more  likely to make it a habit, even if you get to your goal in less time)  </li>
  <li>Are able  and motivated to train with me at least 3 days per week</li>
  <li>Are looking to improve every single aspect of  their lives through fitness</li>
  <li>Want a lean and attractive body, but don't  want to wait forever</li>
  <li>Desire a top fitness trainer who delivers paramount  service</li>
  <li>Deserve the finest life has to offer</li>
  <li>Want to be NOTICED and STAND OUT from their  friends, family and those around them</li>
</ul>
      <p><strong>My Body Sculpting Program Is NOT For Those Who:</strong></p>
      <ul class="red">
        <li>Are NOT serious about getting into the best shape of their lives</li>
        <li>Are looking for a low priced personal trainer who delivers low-end service</li>
        <li>Want to work out only once or twice per week</li>
        <li>Aren't willing to follow my cutting edge body sculpting training system and nutrition plan</li>
        <li>Do NOT want to get a lean and attractive body quickly</li>
        <li>Feel like they don't deserve the best life has to offer</li>
        <li>Do NOT value the way they look and feel and are comfortable with fitting in with the masses </li>

    <h4 align="center">Everywhere you look nowadays, there seems to be yet another new fitness fad out on the market...</h4>
    <p>There  are just so many exercise and diet programs to choose from, that I cannot help  but feel bad for those who have to decide which one to try! </p>
    <p> As we are often barraged with the newest fitness  &quot;breakthroughs&quot; and promised the world in a hand basket, it is very  easy to pick a method that at the time seems to be a great choice, but ends up  being quite... well... a complete waste of your time and energy. </p>
    <p> Training programs ranging from the &quot;brand new,  ultra-effective workout video&quot;, to the &quot;flavor of the month aerobic  style class&quot; that promises the world and more, ends up really only doing  two things... And that's leaving you in a pool of sweat... And completely and  utterly disappointing you with the &quot;results&quot;... </p>
    <p> Yes my friend, I know it all too well...</p>
    <p> There is absolutely no getting around the fact that a  fitness lifestyle is the key to getting an attractive body quickly, and keeping  it for life. </p>
    <p> <strong>A  fitness lifestyle is not having to deprive yourself of delicious foods,  restrict your calories to a point where you have severe hunger pains, or endure  silly workouts for unrealistic amounts of time that yield lackluster results  (AT BEST)... </strong></p>
    <p> A fitness lifestyle is indeed a <em>lifestyle</em>. And coming from someone who is able to be flexible with  his nutrition and workout plan and still maintain a fitness model physique year  round, I practice what I preach and I stand behind my system 100%.</p>
    <p> <em>Wouldn't  you rather have a personal trainer who actually LOOKS like he knows what he's  doing...? I know I would!</em></p>
    <p> <strong>Having  finally mastered my craft that took over a decade to master, I am now able to  bring YOU a fitness experience that is both effective and enjoyable, right to your  doorstep... </strong></p>
    <p><strong>No more wasting your valuable time commuting  back and forth to the gym... No more trying out ineffective fitness programs  and diets that leave you feeling even WORSE than you did before... <em>AND NO MORE FEELING BAD ABOUT THE WAY THAT  YOU LOOK... </em></strong></p>
    <h4 align="center"><strong>SPECIAL DISCOUNTED 3 SESSION INTRO-PACK</strong></h4>
      <p>The Introductory Package to my main fitness program consists of 3 one-hour training sessions that will have you getting real results, right away.  </p>
      <p>My Intro-Pack includes the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Face-to-Face Consultation. There are unique qualities that I look for in a client that have proven to make the most enjoyable and successful trainer-client relationship possible. My Introductory Package allows me to see if you are a good fit for my training services</li>
      <li>Enables me to consult with you on a personal level, giving me the opportunity to align you with a highly customized nutrition plan and body sculpting program, specifically created to reaching your goals</li>
      <li>A complete body composition assessment, including body fat percentage measurements and metabolic rate analysis</li>
      <li>Give you a look into my cutting edge nutritional and exercise strategies I use to unlock your muscle building and fat burning potential</li>
      <li>Find out exactly what it is you're doing wrong and fix it immediately </li>

    <h4>You might be asking yourself - is Destination Fitness Personal Training right for me if...</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>I haven't exercised in a long time (or never)  and I am out of shape?</strong> I know  how hard it is to get back on track after long periods of inactive living. My  client's and myself have had to overcome this obstacle ourselves... This is why  I designed my training for ALL fitness levels, tailoring my program  specifically for YOU.</li>
      <li><strong>I've tried so many different programs before,  but I didn't get good results!?</strong> Being through more fitness programs than I care to count myself, I was  not able to get the results that I wanted for a long time. I used to blame it  on poor genetics, but what I realized through over 10 years of dedication to my  craft was that there is a science to  getting into shape. 99% of trainers and training programs do not and will not  go the extra mile to perfect their craft. Luckily for you, you found someone  who did!  </li>
      <li><strong>I am skeptical about being able to get such  an amazing workout in my own home?</strong> Most people would NEVER guess what it really takes in achieving an  attractive, sculpted physique. They often think it takes a ton of exercise  equipment, a ton of weight and A LOT of room... But this couldn't be further  from the truth... I personally have built much of my physique on equipment that  could fit in a room no bigger than a 10x10 space. Shocking, I know...</li>
      <li><strong>I'm still not sure about this, but I really  do want to make a change in my life!?</strong> It is completely natural to feel uneasy when taking big steps in your  life and I applaud your efforts for seeking a healthier and happier way of  living. But often times, the best decisions in life are made in the presence of  fear and stress. Remember, if within 30 days you are not <strong>100% satisfied</strong> with your training experience with me, I will refund  ALL of your money, right on the spot... You really have NOTHING to lose...  Except pounds of unwanted body fat! </li>
    </ul>
<p>Since the demand for my  services is high, I am <em>almost always</em> at maximum client capacity. In order to bring the absolute best training  experience possible to my clientele, I choose to <em>limit</em> the number of clients I train for the sole purpose of  maximizing the quality of each individualized training session. </p>
    <p> Remember, I only take on  clients who are truly motivated to get an attractive and healthy body. I just  cannot afford to have my reputation hurt by people who aren't willing to do  what it takes to reach their fitness goals. </p>
    <p> At the moment, <em>I do have a small number of slots available</em>.  But there is a good chance I will NOT have room for anymore clients in the  near future and I will have to put you on a waiting list.</p>
