    <p><strong>From Gary Amlinger CFT</strong><br>
      Founder of Destination Fitness Personal Training<br>
      Serving Long Island, New York</p>
      <p>Dear Friend, <br>
Hello. I'm Gary Amlinger, a Long Island fitness trainer,  professional fitness model and body sculpting specialist. I have important questions to ask you and it is imperative that you  answer them truthfully.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have you ever walked into a social gathering and  immediately experienced feelings of self consciousness due to the other  attendees displaying a more healthful appearance? </li>
        <li>Have you ever felt that sinking feeling in the  pit of your stomach as you walked into a business affair, knowing that you were  out of shape and lacked the confidence to boldly follow through?</li>
        <li>Do you fear your significant other's attraction  toward you is waning and he or she might go elsewhere?</li>
        <li>Do you avoid dating because you just don't feel  secure enough about the way that you look and feel?</li>
        <li>Do you feel like you have less fulfilling  relationships with friends and family because you're not completely happy with  yourself?</li>
        <li>Do you dread seeing your reflection in the  mirror and wish that the person looking back at you, was healthier and in  better shape?</li>
        <li>Have you experienced feelings of inadequacy or  even embarrassment when being intimate with another person, which prohibits you  from enjoying intimacy to its fullest?</li>
        <li>Do you sometimes feel guilty about neglecting  your health, knowing that it does not only affect your way of life, but the  life of your loved ones as well? </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    </div>
    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="twelve columns">
         <p>If you answered yes to any of these  questions, let me tell you that you are certainly not alone. I know because at one point in my life, I  could have answered yes to every single question above.</p>
        <p>If  you've never been told this before, allow me to be the first to tell you that it is not your fault. It is 100% not  your fault society has countless views that misinform the masses on what works  and what doesn't work in exercise and nutrition. We live in a world where TV  and magazines advertise fad diets and overly complicated exercise regimens that  do absolutely nothing, but con the consumer into thinking that these methods actually  work and take their hard earned money. Well, as I am sure you have found out  first hand, they do not work. And not only do these fitness fads not work, but  they're remarkably unhealthy.</p>
        <p>Working as a professional fitness model for  almost a decade, I have tapped into a world that most of humanity will never  get to experience. Being immersed in an environment that seeks perfection  in every way possible, there is no room for inadequate nutritional plans or  ineffective training methods. Working as a fitness model, if you aren't in near  perfect shape year round, you will not receive work and in turn, cannot support  yourself to live. Through many years of  studying exercise science and nutrition, and my experience as a professional  fitness model where I was immersed in an environment surrounded by some of the  best physiques in the world, I am able to bring you the true solution to developing  an attractive, lean and healthy body.  </p>

      <h2>I wasn't always Mr. Fitness...</h2>
      <img src="images/gary-amlinger-before.jpg" width="219" height="301" alt="Before" class="floatleft">
      <p>During my teenage years, I was very  self conscious about the way that I looked. Being that I was 120 lbs., ON A  GOOD DAY, you could only imagine how often I was teased and ridiculed. Having  an unhealthy self image, my self esteem was at an absolute zero. I had no  control over myself or any significant aspect of my life. On top of having no  social life or love life, my overall well being suffered greatly.</p>
                <p>As  I began to approach my high school years, I started to become interested in  exercise and nutrition. It fascinated me to see how people could literally  transform their bodies from being overweight or skinny to adopting a persona of  power and confidence through increasing lean muscle mass and attaining low  levels of body fat. After a substantial amount of self-education on health and  fitness, I decided to start working out at the age of 15. My father had  purchased a pair of dumbbells and a workout bench, and I immediately got to  work.</p>
                <p>The  instant I started exercising, I felt a sense of control, power and strength. It  was unlike anything I've ever experienced before. It was as if a wave of relief  had washed over me. At that moment, I  knew deep down inside of me that I was meant to devote my life to fitness. My days of living a powerless life were  over.</p>
	
                
<p><img src="images/gary-amlinger-after.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="298" class="floatleft">At  the age of 16, I decided it was time to put my knowledge to good use by joining  the Mecca of bodybuilding, Bev Francis Gold's Gym. Bev Francis Gold's Gym is  one of the top physique gyms in America. Supermodels, professional athletes and  famous actors work out there on a daily basis, and I felt it was a great  opportunity for me to find out what really works in achieving an appealing  physique. From the moment I stepped into Gold's Gym, I began to pick the brain  of every model, professional athlete and well known actor that I came across.</p>
      <p>Over  the next 3 years of dedicated research and training, I put on over 60 lbs of  muscle mass, all the while maintaining a sub 6% body fat percentage, without the  use of harmful drugs or surgery. However, the way I looked was only the tip of  the iceberg. The most rewarding part of getting into shape was how I felt  inside. This positive energy that I felt within was emitting out into the world  and coming back to me tenfold. Through accomplishing something so extraordinary  and pure, my self-acceptance and self love had literally sky rocketed. I  experienced the same acceptance and approval from others as well. I was no  longer teased, but instead praised and loved. Socially confident I now enjoyed  being with people instead of dreading social situations. I experienced a sense  of well being and vivacity that I've never felt before. It's important to  understand that a true fitness lifestyle isn't only about the way you look, but  about the way you feel. When you wake up in the morning ENERGIZED and  EXCITED about your day, your whole life changes. Your entire outlook on life is  altered in a way that anything you want to achieve is within your grasp. This  is where the power lies in living a fit lifestyle. </p>

    <h2>Immersing Myself In The World of Fitess Modeling allowed me to cultivate the most potent body shaping concepts on Earth</h2>
    <img src="images/as-seen-on.png" width="820" height="44" class="glyphs">
    <p>When I stepped on stage at my first  ALL NATURAL bodybuilding contest at 19 years old, I knew I had come a long way  since the old days of working out at home. But  it wasn't until I became certified as a personal trainer and began to transform  the bodies of my close friends and family with shocking results, that I realized  I had cultivated very effective exercise and nutrition methods.</p>
      <p>Competing  in the INBF (International Natural Bodybuilding and Fitness), which is one of  the top All-Natural Federations in Natural Bodybuilding, I placed as one of the  top ranked teenagers in New York. After my first competition, I was contacted  by top fitness publications such as Exercise For Men Only and Natural  Bodybuilding and Fitness to be featured in their magazines. This was the beginning of my fitness  modeling career and eventually exposure to the most effective body shaping  concepts in the world.</p>
      <p>After  much publicity from being featured in numerous fitness magazines, I came in  contact with one of the top fitness modeling agencies in New York City, Silver  Model Management. Silver Models represents top-tier sports models, professional  athletes and established actors who work with the most recognized companies in  the world including Nike, Under Armour and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Silver  Models also works with high end magazines such as Men's Health and popular TV  shows including Conan O'Brien and Saturday Night Live. Signing with Silver Model Management and immersing myself in the  environment of modeling allowed me to expand my knowledge and skills of fitness  even further than I thought possible. Before I knew it, I was shooting  commercials for MTV, work out videos for the world's leading fitness modeling  website, Strengthnet.com, and being photographed by top fitness photographers  Bill Terry and Norberto Torriente, who's work can be seen in top fitness  magazines such as Exercise For Men Only, and celebrity photographer Mike Ruiz,  who has done photo shoots with the who's who of celebrities including Kim  Kardashian, Eva Longoria, Christian Bale, Justin Timberlake, and Kate  Beckinsale. I also made an appearance in the Apple application, Pretty  Masculine, and have done fight choreography for the up and coming Broadway  show, Das Rocky. Learning from the most  fit people on the planet allowed me to refine my own fitness skill set and take  away cutting edge nutrition and exercise techniques that can be applied to  anyone.</p>
      <p>After my physique transformation and the  transformation of the many people I have helped during my fitness modeling  career, I felt it was time to pursue a vocation that I truly loved and felt the  most fulfilled doing. I love helping people through fitness because I know what  a sound mind and healthy body can do for someone's life. Deciding to  dedicate my life to being a fitness trainer, I armed myself with one of the  leading certifications for fitness trainers in the country, the International  Sports Sciences Association Certified Fitness Trainer certification. The ISSA  Certified Fitness Trainer (CFT) certification is nationally accredited, backed  by some of the industry's leading fitness professionals throughout North  America who's teachings are some of the most prestigious and respected in the  fitness field. The ISSA CFT certification is held by some of the top fitness  trainers in the world including celebrity trainer, Jackie Warner.</p>

      <h2>The REAL Truth About Getting Into Shape</h2>
      <img src="images/fitness-glyphs.png" width="510" height="82" alt="Fitness" class="glyphs">
      <p>There are many lies, myths and misconceptions that you have been  subjected to in regards to getting into shape. Society and the media  portray the &quot;most effective&quot; fat loss and muscle building solutions  in advertisements ranging from magazines to the largest soundboard on earth,  the internet. But the fact of the matter is, the people behind these so called  &quot;solutions&quot; have an agenda, and that agenda DOES NOT have your best  interest at heart. Allow me to clear up  some of the most popular misconceptions that you have been exposed to by  society and the media: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cardio is the optimal way to burn fat</li>
        <li>Women should not weight train because they will  get &quot;bulky&quot;</li>
        <li>The only way to get and stay lean is to stay on  a very low calorie diet</li>
        <li>You can burn fat covering a specific muscle by  exercising that muscle group</li>
        <li>Women shouldn't try to attain muscle, they  should only concern themselves with burning fat</li>
        <li>Diets are all restrictive and bland</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Through my own trials and tribulations, I  too have believed many of the popular myths that are floating around society  today. If I didn't get into the trenches MYSELF to see how fitness really works,  I might have never been able to distinguish the real truth from all the lies. It's not your fault that the media sends out  useless and unhealthy programming regarding fitness. If I did not spend the  last decade of my life devoting my time to exercise and nutrition, I might  still be in the dark as well. Let's take  a closer look at these fitness myths: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cardio is the optimal way to burn fat. FALSE. People who spend hours upon hours  in aerobic style classes, on the treadmill or elliptical, ARE NOT ACCOMPLISHING  ANYTHING, but allowing your metabolism to stay at low levels and burn muscle.  Not only are you wasting your precious time by not utilizing your fat stores  during this type of exercise, but you are actually doing your body a great  disservice by burning lean muscle mass. And  lean muscle mass happens to BURN  CALORIES 24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK, EVEN WHILE YOU ARE SLEEPING!  The key to burning fat is to increase  your metabolism through resistance training and specialized high intensity  interval exercises. The metabolism increase one attains from such exercise  techniques is what will allow your body to BURN  FAT 24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK, EVEN WHILE YOU ARE SLEEPING!  </li>
        <li> Women  should not weight train because they will get &quot;bulky&quot;. FALSE. Weight training does NOT cause women to become bulky. Weight  training MUST be executed in a  certain way for any muscle to be accumulated, let alone for that muscle to  appear bulky. Just think about all of the men slaving away in the gym, TRYING  to put on significant muscle mass, and DON'T.  This is possibly the biggest misconception out of them all. Women can train  with lighter weights, strict form, high reps, low rest periods and build  beautiful, aesthetic bodies. There are also physiological reasons as to why women  will not take on a muscle bound physique, such as lower testosterone and higher  estrogen levels. Women just do NOT have the hormones to build a significant  amount of muscle and when looking to attain a lean and toned physique, the  workout routine will NOT be aimed at building bulk! In fact, the female bodybuilder image that comes to mind when a woman  thinks about lifting weights is EXACTLY the OPPOSITE of what you will look like  after taking part in an effective weight training regimen. Women can and do  attain aesthetic, sculpted bodies through resistance training!   </li>
        <li>The only way to get and stay lean is to stay on  a very low calorie diet. FALSE. When  on an effective nutrition plan, you will actually be eating MORE than you normally do, leaving you  feeling more satiated as well. Low calorie diets are harmful to your health and  overall wellbeing. </li>
        <li>You can burn fat covering a specific muscle by  exercising that muscle group. FALSE.  Spot reduction is physiologically, IMPOSSIBLE. Working out an area of your body  (i.e. Abdominals) will strengthen the muscles UNDERNEATH whatever it is that is  covering it (i.e. Fat, subcutaneous water). Therefore, if you have high levels  of body fat, you will not see your abdominals any better than before you  decided to exercise them.</li>
        <li>Women shouldn't try to attain muscle, they  should only concern themselves with burning fat. FALSE. Lean muscle will accentuate the natural, feminine curves of  the female body and keep your metabolism elevated 24 hours a day. </li>
        <li>Diets are all restrictive and bland. FALSE. Instead of using the word  &quot;diet&quot; which has many negative connotations, I like to use the phrase  &quot;nutrition plan&quot; instead. Nutrition plans that are meant to last a  lifetime are by NO means bland or tasteless. There is much room for indulging  in foods that you enjoy and flavoring the healthy foods that you consume on a  consistent basis to your liking. There is a wide variety of foods out there  that are both healthy and delicious when prepared correctly. Being healthy is  all about living a fitness lifestyle. Eating foods you do not like will get you  about as far as your will power will take you until you eventually binge. This  is what we look to avoid as fitness professionals. In fact, when on a strategically structured nutrition plan, you can expect  to no longer crave foods that drain you of energy and store body fat. The body  begins to crave foods that make your body feel energized and no longer does it  crave foods that will send your energy levels on a rollercoaster ride.   </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 align="center">Regardless of what kind of shape you are in  now, realize that I have been there myself....</h3>

      <p>Throughout  my life, I have been at both ends of the body composition spectrum. During my  teenage years, I went from being 120 lbs. of just skin and bone to a muscular,  aesthetic 190 lbs. At a later date however, I suffered a series of very  traumatic events which left me immobile for a long period of time. This caused  me to go from a lean and sculpted 190 lbs. to gaining over 30 lbs. of fat,  weighing in at just over 220 lbs. </p>

    <h2>Why My Program Is Different</h2>
    <p>There  are a ton of personal trainers and training programs out there to chose from  and every one of them will promise results,  but more often than not fail to  deliver them. Most personal trainers will preach about specialized training  techniques or nutrition plans that will get you into shape. But when you see  the personal trainer in person, do they practice what they preach? If their  system works so well, then why aren't they in tip top shape? Well, it's because  their system doesn't work very well or it will work, but only for a very short  period of time. And like all of the  other fads out on the market, it will eventually stop working.</p>
                <p>A  fitness lifestyle is not having to deprive yourself of delicious foods,  restrict your calories to a point where you have sever hunger pains, or work  out for unrealistic amounts of time. A fitness lifestyle is indeed a lifestyle.  And coming from someone who is able to be flexible with his nutrition and  workout plan and still maintain a fitness model physique year round, I practice  what I preach and I stand behind my  system  100%. I am able to do this because  I live a fitness lifestyle, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  Having to be in top condition at all times due to casting calls only giving 2-3  days of notice TOPS, I have manipulated and calculated every single scenario  possible regarding exercise and nutrition, so I can live a lifestyle that is  both enjoyable and healthy. The secret to quick results that are long lasting  is to setup a fitness program that one enjoys and looks forward to. If one is  not happy about the process of getting into shape, they won't stick around for  the results.  </p>
