        This is as close as you get to guaranteed checks in the Reining   Futurities! You will not find a filly this well bred at any other   facility.  On the top side of her pedigree, she is by U.S. National   Champion and two-time Canadian National Reserve Champion, Zee Mega   Bucks. On the bottom side, she is out of an own daughter of Chic Please,   earner of over $209,000 in both the NRHA and NRCHA.  Chic Please is an   NRHA Open Futurity Champion and NRCHA Open Snaffle Bit Futurity   Champion. There is not a more athletic, well minded prospect for the   Reining division out there! This is the opportunity of a lifetime to own   a future Champion that will also produce future Champions for you!<br>

        Wonderful, athletic Reining prospect. By U.S. National Champion   stallion, Zee Mega Bucks. We have no doubt he will follow in his sire's   footsteps due to his great attitude and terrific conformation. His low   hocks coupled with his well-bred talent will enable him to take to the   Reining division with ease.<br>
