<h1>Proven Performance</h1>
<p>The Proven Performance breeding concept was created by Russ &amp;   Mary Jane Brown of Diamond B Training Stables and Robb and Katie Walther   of Rocking W Performance Horses to explain the philosophy of their   breeding program.  The partnership between the couples was formed after   Robb and Katie decided to get into the breeding business after showing   and competing in the Reining, Hunter Pleasure and Western Pleasure   amateur classes for many years under the guidance of the Browns.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Russ trains Reining horses and is known as one of the industry   leaders in Arabian Reining.  Mary Jane trains the Western and Hunter   Pleasure horses while maintaining a hectic schedule as a very respected   and well-know Arabian show judge.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>With a background in NRHA Reining, Robb Walther found himself   involved in Arabians due to the interest of his wife, Katie.  Although   he enjoyed the Arabian Reining world, he was not ready to leave his NRHA   roots so he decided to build upon his NRHA foundation with his new   found interest in the Arabian breed.</p>
<p>After the Walthers bred a stallion prospect that the Browns began to   develop into a solid Reining horse, they realized they had the same   goals and breeding philosophies...To breed proved sires and dams to   produce superior Western performance offspring.  In Robb's own words, he   explains, "With our Arabian Stallion, Zallas Classic Zee, who came from   a National Champion sire and a National Champion Mare, we knew we had   the top side of a breeding program covered.  Instead of breeding him to   only Arabian mares, we set out to find the best AQHA bloodlines to cross   on him and build the bottom side of a pedigree."</p>
<p>With the Half-Arabian Reining industry gaining momentum, The Browns   and the Walthers found they were headed in the same direction.  "It made   a lot of strategic sense to partner up with the Browns" explains Robb.    "We didn't see the point of competing with each other for breedings   when we really had the same goals in mind.  Plus, it gave us the   financial strength to spend on marketing and gave us the flexibility   within our own breeding program as we can share breedings.  If I want to   develop something with one of my horses, I can."<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>While the most successful matches to date have come from an Arabian   sire and out of a Quarter Horse mare, each breeding is looked at   individually with the thought that the resulting foal is a product of   not just two horses, but of the Proven Performance Program.  "We believe   in true mare power.  We pride ourselves on finding the best mares to   breed to our National Champion stallions," says Russ, whose broodmare   band includes Quarter Horse pedigrees such as Doc Tom Tucker, Genunine   Doc, and Chic Please.  While Walther's broodmare band consists of   Chocolate Chic Olena, Doc N Jose and West Coast Whiz mares.  Both   partners have also continued to develop their pure bred Arabian stock by   breeding to mares that come from the established lines of   Ferzon/Azraff, Negatraz, *Cytrus and Old Skoroneck.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>"We like a nice smooth topline, low hock set and a balanced body.    Pretty much the same thing that the Quarter Horse breeders are looking   for in their matches," said Russ.  To look at just about any horse on   the property one would be hard pressed to find one that looks like a   stereotypical Arabian.  From the broad chests to the round hindquarters   these Arabians are nothing like the Arabians many of us are used to   seeing."<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Walther adds, "We don't just breed by accident and hope we get a good   one.  We look critically at the mare.  Each stallion has certain   qualities that they pass on and we try to breed for the body type we   want, whether we are breeding Full or Half-Arabians.  For example, my   Chocolate Chic Olena mare will be bred to Zee Mega Bucks rather than my   own stallion because I want to add more length to her neck.  Each   stallion has his own strengths; stronger hips or shorter/longer hips,   cleaner front end or longer neck.  A lot of times, when we go to   Scottsdale and other big shows, we talk to mare owners about what they   want.  We look at the mare that they want to breed.  We are able to   suggest the stallion that is most likely to produce what they want."<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>While the majority of the barn's resources have been dedicated to   breeding and training Western performance horses, there's a unique   flavor added by Mary Jane Brown's dedication to the other performance   divisions such as Western and Hunter Pleasure.  "I'm an Arab person,   through and through," say Mary Jane.  "We are not just a Reining barn or   just an Arabian barn."  This diversity has allowed them to have a   larger footprint in the industry and has greatly contributed to their   success and the development of their breeding and training programs.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Mary Jane has successfully ridden her pleasure stallion, Xtreme Dream   to both National Championship and Scottsdale Championship titles. "What   we have here are athletes," says Mary Jane definitively.  "They come   from Polish Arabian lines, which are strong performance lines that have   been bred to be enduring and athletic."<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Several years ago Russ began training a stallion named Hesa Zee.  "He   was a phenomenal horse," says Russ, who was enamored enough with the   stallion that he purchased him.  Hesa Zee was sired by a renowned   stallion, Xenophonn, who has been referred to as the 'Doc Bar' of the   Arabian industry.  After proving himself as an industry leader,   Xenophonn retired from cutting competition in 1982 with three National   Championships and three Reserve National Championships.  Until his   death, he sired more than 20 National and Reserve National Champions,   most of which are Cutting and Reining horses.  As well, he was known as a   leading sire of performance Arabians and Half-Arabians.  That is why   his breeding is the cornerstone of the Proven Performance Reining   stallions.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>Russ &amp; Mary Jane Brown are passionate about the beautiful horses   at their facility.  Both are focused on increasing the quality of the   Arabian horse, which has led them to stand several well-bred stallions   and create the Proven Performance Program with their long time clients,   Robb &amp; Katie Walther.  The horses at Diamond B Training Stables and   the ones produced by Proven Performance have desirable characteristics   for any breed: trainable minds and athletic talent suited for both open   and amateur competition.</p>
